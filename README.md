# ♟️ Console Chess (Java)

A **console-based chess game** written in Java. This is a solo project I built to practice programming, sharpen problem-solving skills, and experiment with object-oriented design.

---

## Features (Planned)

* ASCII art for chess pieces displayed in the terminal
* Move input using **standard algebraic notation** (e.g., `Nf4` — Knight to f4)
* Turn-based gameplay with move validation and basic rule enforcement

---

## Input / How to play

1. Run the program from the terminal.
2. The board is displayed with ASCII piece art and coordinates.
3. Players enter moves using algebraic notation (examples):

   * `e4` — pawn to e4
   * `Nf3` — knight to f3
   * `O-O` or `O-O-O` — castling (if implemented)

> Example: `Nf4` means "Knight to f4".

## Goal

This repository is primarily a learning exercise. The focus is on:

* Implementing chess mechanics (piece movement, turns, capture)
* Writing clean, modular Java code and practicing design patterns
* Building a small playable system without a GUI

---

## Status

* **In progress** — core movement and input parsing are being developed.
* This is a personal practice project rather than a production-ready game.

---

## Future improvements (ideas)

* Full check / checkmate detection and stalemate handling
* Save/load game to a file
* Simple AI opponent (minimax or heuristic-based)
* Move history and undo functionality

---

## Notes

* No external libraries required — standard Java only.
* Contributions welcome if you want to collaborate, but the repo is primarily for my own learning.

---

*Made for practice & personal growth.*
